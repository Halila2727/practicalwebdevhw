    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, I am Halil, a junior at Hunter College. I am a computer 
        science student who has created this resume for the purposes of 
        a homework assignment which is due on September 16th! So I am 
        putting the finishing touches as I am writing this as this is 
        the last page. I don't exactly recall what is supposed to go on
        this page. So, enjoy this stock corporate party footage.
